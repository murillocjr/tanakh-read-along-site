Even before I started this project, when I was first learning Hebrew, I was able to get audio recordings and text for the Tanakh on the internet.
# Text

While there are a number of sources online where Hebrew text may be found, with [Sepharia Library](https://www.sefaria.org/texts) being one of the best, the text for this project was obtained from [Biblehub](https://biblehub.com/) since the "Translation Table" style is convenient and fits the read-along process well.

# Audio

I acquired the audio from [Talking Bibles International](https://www.talkingbibles.org/) and had to cut out certain parts that weren't in the text, such as the book and chapter introductions.

# Lexicon & Dictionary

## Biblehub

[Biblehub](https://biblehub.com/) makes its translation tables accessible for download, which contain all of the information needed for the read-along word-by-word matching process, including phonetic symbols for each word's pronunciation, as shown in the sample below:

```bash
wə·ḏe·reḵ
```
which has to be mapped to the Montreal Forced Aligner's phonetic system:

```bash
W AE1 D EH0 R EH0 JH
```
For this, I created a python script that does the "translation" using the following equivalences discovered through manual testing:

 ```python
PHONETIC_EQUIVALENCES = {
    "a": "AH0",
    chr(8216) + "a": "AH1",
    chr(8217) + "a": "AH2",
    "ā": "AA0",
    chr(8216) + "ā": "AA1",
    chr(8217) + "ā": "AA2",
    "å": "AO0",

    chr(703) + "a": "AY0",
    chr(703) + "ă": "AY1",

    "o": "OY0",

    chr(8217) + "o": "OY2",
    "ō": "OW0",
    chr(8216) + "ō": "OW1",
    chr(8217) + "ō": "OW2",

    chr(8217) + "u": "UH2",
    "ū": "UW0",
    chr(8216) + "ū": "UW1",
    chr(8217) + "ū": "UW2",

    "w": "W",
    "y": "IY0",
    "z": "Z",
}
```

The Translation Tables were available as a 40+ MB excel file that Google Sheets and OpenOffice refused to access, necessitating the usage of a Python script to divide it into Json files.

## The OSHB Hebrew Lexicon

I contemplated using data from [The OSHB Hebrew Lexicon](https://github.com/openscriptures/HebrewLexicon), which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, however it only included a pronunciation lexicon for entries in its dictionary, leaving out a lot of Tanakh conjugated terms. The whole information can be found on Biblehub.
